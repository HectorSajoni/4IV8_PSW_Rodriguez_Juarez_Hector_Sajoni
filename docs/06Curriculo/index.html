                <h2>Who I am</h2><br>
                <h3>I am looking for a java programmer job in my spare time, currently I study in the afternoons at 
                    CECyT 9 "Juan de dios Bátiz", I enter school at one in the afternoon and leave at nine at night, 
                    I get up at approximately 9:30 and it takes 40 minutes to get to school, so I have very little 
                    free time during the week.
                </h3><br>
                <h2>My experience</h2><br>
                <h3>
                    The experience that I have working is totally non-existent, more so if it is a programmer job, 
                    but I got a 10 in object-oriented programming and I have programmed different basic level codes
                </h3>
                <h2>Skills</h2><br>
                <h3>
                    Among my main skills are the ability to work in a team, active listening and research. when I 
                    make a mistake I am fully capable of realizing it and accepting it, I also often seek the advice 
                    of people more experienced than me to correct it
